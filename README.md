# 🤖 Hackathon Agent: Your Virtual Hackathon Buddy! 

Hey there, tech enthusiasts and code warriors! 👋 Welcome to the most awesome hackathon helper you'll ever meet!

## 🎭 What's This All About?

Ever wished you had a super-smart sidekick during hackathons? Well, wish granted! The Hackathon Agent is like having a tech-savvy friend who:
- Never sleeps (because, duh, it's a bot! 😴)
- Always has your back
- Knows all the cool tricks
- Doesn't drink all your Red Bull!

## ✨ Features That'll Make You Go "Woah!"

### 🎯 Smart Task Management
- Keeps track of your brilliant ideas (even the 3 AM ones!)
- Helps organize your team's chaos into beautiful order
- Makes sure you don't forget that amazing feature you promised to build

### 🤝 Team Collaboration
- Connects team members like a digital cupid
- Shares updates faster than you can say "git push"
- Keeps everyone in sync (no more "who was supposed to do what?" moments)

1. Clone this repo (the usual git magic)
2. Install dependencies (because we all need a little help from our friends)
3. Configure your settings (make it yours!)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuizFilipeMoura/hackathon-agent
cd hackathon-agent
npm install
# Follow the setup instructions and you're golden!
