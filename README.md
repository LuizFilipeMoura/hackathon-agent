# Hackathon Agent

This project explores the fascinating world of AI Agents - autonomous software entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals. AI Agents combine artificial intelligence, machine learning, and decision-making capabilities to perform tasks with varying degrees of autonomy.

AI Agents work by following a continuous cycle of:
1. Perceiving their environment through inputs
2. Processing information using AI/ML models
3. Making decisions based on their objectives
4. Taking actions to achieve their goals
5. Learning from the outcomes

These agents can be designed for various purposes, from simple task automation to complex problem-solving. They can work independently or collaborate with humans and other agents, making them valuable tools for automation, decision support, and innovation in technology.

This hackathon project demonstrates the practical implementation of AI Agents, showcasing their capabilities in real-world applications.
